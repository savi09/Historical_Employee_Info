# Historical_Employee_Info
Using postgres to get data on employees from the 1980s and 1990s

We were asked to gather the following information:

        1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
        
        2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
        
        3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager’s employee number, last name, first name.
        
        4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
        
        5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is “Hercules” and last names begin with “B.”
        
        6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
        
        7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
        
        8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
        
In the SQL file ![Employee_db Queries](https://github.com/savi09/Historical_Employee_Info/blob/main/Employee_db%20Queries.sql) you will find eight queries broken up for each segment above.

To gather this information, employee_db database was used. An entity relationship diagram (ERD) can be found below and with the files in this github.
